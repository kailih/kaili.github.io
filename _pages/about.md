Hi! I'm an enthusiastic machine learning engineer and researcher. My interests broadly include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, question answering, dialog systems, knowledge graphs, etc.

I'm currently a master's student in computer science at **Stanford University** and I've just finished my first year. This summer (2022), I'm interning at **Microsoft** as an Applied Scientist Intern.

Before attending Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree from **Tsinghua University**, and then worked at **ByteDance** as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer for 1 year.
