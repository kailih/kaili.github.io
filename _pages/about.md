Hi! I'm an enthusiastic machine learning engineer and researcher. My interests broadly include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, question answering, dialog systems, knowledge graphs, etc.

I'm currently a master's student in computer science at Stanford University and I've just finished my first year. This summer, I'm interning at *Microsft* as a Data & Applied Scientist Intern.

Before attending Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, and then worked at ByteDance as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer for 1 year.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
